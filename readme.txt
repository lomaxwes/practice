Приложение Places Remember на стадии разработки в целях обучения!

The Places Remember application is currently under development for educational purposes.

Task description:
The user visits the website and sees a page with a brief description
of the service. They also notice buttons for "Sign in with Google/VK".
Upon clicking the button, Google/VK prompts them to grant access to
their basic information. After granting access, a page should open.
The header of the page will display the user's name and profile photo
(retrieved from their Google/VK profile). In the center of the page,
there will be a message saying "You don't have any memories yet" and
a button "Add a memory" (the placement of the button is at your discretion).
When the user clicks the button, a form should open allowing them to specify a location on the map, as well as enter a name and comment for that place.

The user can then click the "Save" button, and they will be redirected
back to the home page with the added memory displayed in the list.
They will also have the option to add new places. The entire list of
added places will be displayed on the home page.

On the user's home page, there is also a button that allows them
to log out of their account. After logging out, they should be 
redirected to the welcome page of the service without the ability 
to see the list of visited places. Upon reauthorization through
Google/VK, the user will again see all their added places.
